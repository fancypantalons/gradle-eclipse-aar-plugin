Gradle plugin to use Android AAR libraries on Eclipse.  
With this plugin, you can manage dependencies with Gradle and build app on Eclipse.

Android Studio has been officially released, but some of you still want/are forced to use Eclipse ADT for some reasons.
Android Studio has much better build system by integrating Gradle, and many of the remarkable features are unavailable in Eclipse.
In particular, many Android libraries are provided with AAR format recently, so it's now big disadvantage for Eclipse to manage these dependencies.
This plugin will explode AAR libraries and create "Android Library Project"s or copy JARs for your project by executing just one command, and you just import these projects in Eclipse.

Originally I was inspired by [this article](http://www.nodeclipse.org/projects/gradle/android/aar-for-Eclipse), then rewrote almost all of it and added many improvements to automate conversion process and to cover several dependency/project conditions.

## Prerequisites

Eclipse ADT is no longer maintained by Google, and it's forked into the [Andmore](https://github.com/eclipse/andmore) project.

This plugin is tested under these conditions.

* [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers 4.5 (Mars)](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/mars2)
* [Andmore](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/andmore)

For the original Eclipse ADT Plugin developed by Google, the plugin is tested under the following conditions.

* [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers 4.4 (Luna) SR1](https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/lunasr1a)
* [Eclipse ADT Plugin](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html)

## Usage

### Prepare build.gradle

If your project already uses Gradle and Android Studio, just apply this plugin.

Gradle 2.1+:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        // or jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.0.0'
    }
}

plugins {
    id 'com.github.ksoichiro.eclipse.aar' version '0.3.1'
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
```

Gradle 2.0 and former:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        // Enable this if you use SNAPSHOT
        //maven {
        //    url uri('https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/')
        //}
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.0.0'
        classpath 'com.github.ksoichiro:gradle-eclipse-aar-plugin:0.3.1'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

// Apply this plugin
apply plugin: 'com.github.ksoichiro.eclipse.aar'
```

And configure it in `eclipseAar` closure.

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

// Write your dependencies
dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.2'
    compile 'com.nineoldandroids:library:2.4.0'
    compile 'com.melnykov:floatingactionbutton:1.0.7'
    compile 'com.github.ksoichiro:android-observablescrollview:1.5.0'
}

// Configure eclipse-aar plugin
eclipseAar {
    // See "Configurations" for details
    androidTarget = 'android-21'
    aarDependenciesDir = 'aarDependencies'
    // Set to true if you use Andmore. Default is false
    andmore = true
}

// Configure android plugin
// (Even if you don't develop with Gradle, write following at least)
android {
    compileSdkVersion 1

    // Source directory is 'src/main/java' by default.
    // This will be added as a classpath entry in .classpath file.
    // If you'd like to set src directory other than that,
    // override it with sourceSets.main.java.srcDirs like this.
    sourceSets {
        main {
            java.srcDirs = [ 'src' ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Migrate from Eclipse ADT to Andmore

If you're going to migrate from Eclipse ADT to Andmore, please check the following notes.

#### Remove or edit meta data files

Please remove the meta data files (`.classpath` and `.project`) in your app project  
or edit them manually before executing tasks.

Those files are slightly different between ADT and Andmore - package has been changed  
from `com.android.ide.eclipse.adt` to `org.eclipse.andmore` - and  
if they're not changed, Andmore does not recognize the projects.

Perhaps this plugin can/should overwrite those files in the future,  
but currently it respects the existent contents.

#### Set andmore flag

Set `eclipseAar.andmore` option to `true` to generate the meta data files (`.classpath` and `.project`) for Andmore.

### Prepare Gradle or Gradle wrapper

Install Gradle 2.2.1+.

Or copy Gradle wrapper files into your project.
If you use Gradle wrapper, you don't have to install Gradle.

* `gradle\wrapper\`
* `gradlew`
* `gradlew.bat`

### Generate dependencies

```sh
$ ./gradlew generateEclipseDependencies
```

JAR dependencies will be copied to `libs` directory,  
and AAR dependencies will be exploded and copied to `aarDependencies` directory by default.

### Import projects to Eclipse and build app

1. Launch Eclipse.
1. Select `File` > `Import`.
1. Select `General` > `Existing Projects into Workspace` and click `Next`.
1. Click `Browse` and select project root directory.
1. Check `Search for nested projects`.
1. Select all projects and click next.  
   Note that if you've imported projects in Eclipse before, there might be `bin` directories and they might be recognized as projects, but don't select them.
1. Some warning messages might be generated, but ignore them and wait until build finishes.

### Run the app

1. Confirm your device is connected.
1. Right click your main project and select `Run As` > `Android Application`.

### project.properties?

Eclipse ADT plugin uses `project.properties` file to manage library project dependencies.  

If you don't have `project.properties` file, this plugin will create it.  
If you have `project.properties` file but don't have the required AAR dependency entries in it, this plugin will add these entries, too.  
Therefore you don't have to care about them.

But please note that if you have file dependencies (`libs/xxx.jar`),
you should manually add entries for them to `project.properties` file.

### .classpath files?

Eclipse has `.classpath` files to manage dependencies.  
For Android apps, each library projects must be declared as `<classpathentry>` tags in `.classpath` file.

If you don't have `.classpath` file, this plugin will create it.  
If you have `.classpath` file but don't have `<classpathentry>`s for the required libraries in it, this plugin will add these entries, too.  
Therefore you don't have to care about them.

But please note that if you have file dependencies (`libs/xxx.jar`),
you should manually add entries for them to `.classpath` file.

Note that `.classpath` file generated by ADT is not recognized by Andmore.  
To develop with Andmore, set `eclipseAar.andmore` to `true`.

### .project files?

Eclipse has `.project` files to manage project description.  
If you don't have `.project` file, this plugin will create it, so you don't have to care about them.

Note that `.project` file generated by ADT is not recognized by Andmore.  
To develop with Andmore, set `eclipseAar.andmore` to `true`.

## Samples

See `samples` directory.

Each projects refer to `samples/repo` directory as a Maven repository.
You must generate it before using samples with following command:

```sh
$ cd /path/to/this/project/root/
$ ./gradlew clean assemble uploadArchives
```

After that, you can try this plugin in each projects.  
Example:

```sh
$ cd ./samples/example/
$ ./gradlew generateEclipseDependencies
```
